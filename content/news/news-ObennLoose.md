# Ob'enn On The March Again


Tausennigan Ob’enn, once contained in their own system by an alliance fleet blockade of their wormgate, have taken advantage of the teraport to facilitate a
return to their expansionist war on multiple fronts. 

Tausennigan Kss'thrata evacuated their entire planet’s population to locations unknown using teraports just in time to avoid a genocidal invasion by the Ob’enn. 
With their longstanding enemy out of the way and their home system secured, the massive Ob’enn war machine has been redirected outside their home system to support 
new wars against those who once held their ambitions in check.
