# Gav Bleuel - Most Clones of Single Sophont in History


950 million Gav clones were unleashed on the galaxy, making blue-haired Caucasian men who like Guinness the single largest demographic in the galaxy. 
Sources claim the feat is somehow related to an alleged conspiracy by the Wormgate Corporation. 

**Bio:**

The handsome, blue-haired scientist is one of the oldest humans in the Galaxy, if you're counting from birth dates. 
Born in the late 20th century, "Gav" studied nuclear physics (earning a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering in 2003) and worked for the government, 
but actually ended up making his fortune in the entertainment industry. In a quest to live to see the distant future, he had himself cryogenically frozen 
just prior to the Content Crash of the early 21st century. Thanks to the resultant depletion of his estate, he spent most of the next 1000-odd years being 
shuffled from one dusty, forgotten collegiate laboratory to another. He was thawed out by a teaching assistant in the late 31st century on the premise that 
"maybe this box labelled 'ancient biologicals' will have something nifty in it."
