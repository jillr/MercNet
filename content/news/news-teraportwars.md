# Teraport Wars


Since the teraport was suddenly released into the public domain 3 months ago, most governments and large companies have been scrambling to implement TAD systems 
and retrofit teraports onto their ships. Not everyone has them yet. Civilian vessels and poorer systems may still lack TAD, or only have short range/partial coverage. 
Most civilian vessels donâ€™t have teraports yet.

Wars have erupted galaxy-wide as enemies and opportunists attempt to take advantage of the situation.
