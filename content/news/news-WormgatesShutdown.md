# Wormgates Shut Down in 20k Systems


Twenty thousand wormgates suddenly shut down yesterday, leaving major population centers accessable only via teraport. Whole sectors of the galaxtic economy have been crippled. 
Wormgate Corp blames the shutdowns on destruction of infrastructure from Admiral Breya Andreyasnâ€™s unprovoked attack. 
Other sources claim that this is retaliation in an attempt to blackmail galactic powers into punishing the Admiral and participating allied governments.
