<p>950 million Gav clones were unleashed on the galaxy, making blue-haired Caucasian men who like Guinness the single largest demographic in the galaxy.
Sources claim the feat is somehow related to an alleged conspiracy by the Wormgate Corporation.</p>
<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>
<p>The handsome, blue-haired scientist is one of the oldest humans in the Galaxy, if you&rsquo;re counting from birth dates.
Born in the late 20th century, &ldquo;Gav&rdquo; studied nuclear physics (earning a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering in 2003) and worked for the government,
but actually ended up making his fortune in the entertainment industry. In a quest to live to see the distant future, he had himself cryogenically frozen
just prior to the Content Crash of the early 21st century. Thanks to the resultant depletion of his estate, he spent most of the next 1000-odd years being
shuffled from one dusty, forgotten collegiate laboratory to another. He was thawed out by a teaching assistant in the late 31st century on the premise that
&ldquo;maybe this box labelled &lsquo;ancient biologicals&rsquo; will have something nifty in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tausennigan Ob’enn, once contained in their own system by an alliance fleet blockade of their wormgate, have taken advantage of the teraport to facilitate a
return to their expansionist war on multiple fronts.</p>
<p>Tausennigan Kss&rsquo;thrata evacuated their entire planet’s population to locations unknown using teraports just in time to avoid a genocidal invasion by the Ob’enn.
With their longstanding enemy out of the way and their home system secured, the massive Ob’enn war machine has been redirected outside their home system to support
new wars against those who once held their ambitions in check.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand wormgates suddenly shut down yesterday, leaving major population centers accessable only via teraport. Whole sectors of the galaxtic economy have been crippled.
Wormgate Corp blames the shutdowns on destruction of infrastructure from Admiral Breya Andreyasn’s unprovoked attack.
Other sources claim that this is retaliation in an attempt to blackmail galactic powers into punishing the Admiral and participating allied governments.</p>

<p>Since the teraport was suddenly released into the public domain 3 months ago, most governments and large companies have been scrambling to implement TAD systems
and retrofit teraports onto their ships. Not everyone has them yet. Civilian vessels and poorer systems may still lack TAD, or only have short range/partial coverage.
Most civilian vessels don’t have teraports yet.</p>
<p>Wars have erupted galaxy-wide as enemies and opportunists attempt to take advantage of the situation.</p>
